Crew AI is a system that allows multiple AI agents to work together to solve complex problems. Here's a simple breakdown of its three main components:

Agents: These are like team members, each with specific skills and roles. They work on tasks and collaborate with other agents to achieve goals.

Tasks: These are the jobs or assignments that agents need to complete. Tasks can be simple or complex and are designed to be manageable and focused.

Tools: These are the resources or functions that agents use to do their tasks, such as software, databases, or APIs.

Tools help agents perform their roles effectively.

Together, these components enable AI agents to collaborate and solve problems efficiently.
